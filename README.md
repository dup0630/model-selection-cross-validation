# Project: Cross-Validation for Model Selection

## To do
- Fix simulation efficiency (switch to k-fold where appropriate, verify correctness)
- Continue typing notes (fill in gaps in Shao papers, create next sections)
- Fix assumptions enumeration.
- I still don't understand how the size p_n(\alpha) of a model can change with n.

## Topics
- Selection procedures:
    - Loo, k-fold averaging, majority-vote, single-split, convex aggregation.
- Settings
    - Linear model selection, nonparametric procedures.

## Literature
- Shao, 1993
- Shao, 1997
- Yang, 2007
- Bunea, Tsybakov 2007
- Tsybakov, 2009

# Questions
- Yang, p 17: typo?
- Varying correct linear models.
- Bunea, Tsybakov: Tn over all estimators?
