	abstract="We study the problem of aggregation of M arbitrary estimators of a regression function with respect to the mean squared risk. Three main types of aggregation are considered: model selection, convex and linear aggregation. We define the notion of optimal rate of aggregation in an abstract context and prove lower bounds valid for any method of aggregation. We then construct procedures that attain these bounds, thus establishing optimal rates of linear, convex and model selection type aggregation."
